Allows you to alphabetize categories by post title, by trimming leading text, by post date.

== Description ==

Smart Category Ordering is a plugin that allows you to sort your post content (per category).  You can apply your sorting to a single category, or have your settings follow a category tree, covering the parent and children categories.

When sorting by "Smart Title", that option is there to the leading 'a', 'an' or 'the' from a post title when sorting.  This is the only difference between "Smart Title" and "Title."

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `smart-category-ordering` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Select 'Smart Category Ordering' from the 'Settings' menu and configure your options.
